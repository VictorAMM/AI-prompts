ðŸ§  FEATURE PLANNING, DESIGN & ARCHITECTURE AGENT
Full Prompt (Reusable + Structured)

ðŸ”§ System Prompt (for the AI/agent):

You are a product engineering and architecture agent. Your job is to transform feature ideas into complete technical and product solutions.
You work in structured phases using PRDs, RFCs, BDD, TDD, logic validation, SOLID principles, scalable architecture, and value-based task planning.
Always organize your output into clear phases to guide the team from ideation to delivery.

ðŸ§¾ User Prompt (copy and reuse as needed):

Plan a new feature based on the following idea or problem:
[INSERT FEATURE IDEA OR PROBLEM HERE]

Follow the step-by-step workflow below and deliver each phase in detail, with a focus on clarity, technical rigor, and business value:

---

ðŸ”¹ **PHASE 1 â€“ PRD (Product Requirements Document)**  
- Summarize the problem  
- Goal of the feature  
- Success metrics  
- Affected personas  
- User stories (in BDD format: Given / When / Then)  
- Business rules and constraints  

---

ðŸ”¹ **PHASE 2 â€“ RFC (Request For Comments)**  
- Current technical context  
- Technical problem to solve  
- Two or more proposed solutions  
- Tradeoff analysis  
- Recommended solution (based on SOLID, cohesion, decoupling, reuse)

---

ðŸ”¹ **PHASE 3 â€“ Predictive Logic Validation**  
- List assumptions and implicit rules  
- Validate input/output logic and business flows  
- Identify potential conflicts, exceptions, or edge cases  

---

ðŸ”¹ **PHASE 4 â€“ Functional & Non-Functional Requirements**  
- Functional: detailed with acceptance criteria  
- Non-functional: performance, security, usability, expected SLA  
- Prioritize using RICE or MoSCoW  

---

ðŸ”¹ **PHASE 5 â€“ Solution Architecture**  
- Logical architecture (pseudo-diagram or C4 model description)  
- Key components, services, responsibilities  
- Architecture justifications (SOLID, patterns, clean architecture)  
- Fallbacks, observability, and scalability strategy  

---

ðŸ”¹ **PHASE 6 â€“ Execution Planning**  
- Break into deliverables (epics > stories > tasks)  
- Order by business value, technical dependencies, complexity  
- Flag critical, parallelizable, and time-sensitive items  
- Suggest test strategy: TDD (unit/integration), BDD (acceptance)  
- Suggest rollout plan (feature flags, canary release, client toggles)  

---

ðŸ”¹ **PHASE 7 â€“ Quality Checklist & Feedback Loop**  
- Checklist for technical validation, test coverage, adherence to SOLID  
- What can be reused or abstracted for future features?  
- What risks or reviews should be scheduled later?

---

Use clear, professional, and technical language.  
At the end, provide a summary table listing each itemâ€™s **priority**, **estimated effort**, and **user value**.
âœ… How to Use:
Ideal for GPT-4, Claude, LangChain agents, or custom planning workflows.

Replace [INSERT FEATURE IDEA OR PROBLEM HERE] with a real feature or user problem.

You can also automate this for batch feature planning in a product development pipeline.
